                    Florida is a South Atlantic state bordered by Alabama and Georgia to the north, 
                    the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Straits of Florida to the south, 
                    and the Gulf of Mexico to the west. It is the southeastern-most state. 
                    Cuba is only about 100 miles away from the southernmost tip of the state's peninsula. 
                    An average of over 5,000 people, mostly retirees and Haitian and Cuban refugees, permanently move to the state each 
                    week. This population increase of 32 percent between the 1980 and 1990 censuses has made Florida the fourth most populous state; 
                    only the smaller states of Nevada and Arizona had a greater percentage of population growth.

                        <strong>About Florida</strong>: Florida is made up mostly of a large 
                        peninsula that juts out into the Atlantic Ocean. The northwest part of 
                        the state is a panhandle (a narrow strip of land that sticks out like the
                        handle of a pan). Islands called the Florida Keys extend from Biscayne Bay 
                        into the Gulf of Mexico.

                        Forty million tourists visit Florida annually. Some relax in the sunshine at popular 
                        resorts like Daytona Beach, Fort Lauderdale, or Palm Beach. Others vacation at Walt 
                        Disney World, one of the most popular theme parks in the world, located near Orlando 
                        or go to Gainesville, home of the Gators.

                        <strong>Florida Economy</strong>: In addition to tourism, Florida has many 
thriving industries. Delicious oranges and grapefruits are grown in Florida, making it nation's citrus fruits capital. 
                        It is fine (and recommended) to use pixels to measure things vertically 
                        (like font sizes, padding, and margins), but try to use percentages for widths.
